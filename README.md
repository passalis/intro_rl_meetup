Reinforcement Learning: All you need to know (Thessaloniki Machine Learning Meetup)

In this repository we provide some python notebooks that demonstrate how to implement and use two basic RL algorithms, i.e., Policy Gradients and Q-learning, and how they can be combined with Deep Learning models.

You can also find more material (presentation, etc.) from the meetup [here](https://www.meetup.com/Thessaloniki-Machine-Learning-Meetup/events/256633659/?read=1&_xtd=gatlbWFpbF9jbGlja9oAJDBlNjdhZjMwLTg0MjItNDY4OC1iZTQ4LWEzMGFiYjljZjBlOA&_af=event&_af_eid=256633659)!
